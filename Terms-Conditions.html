<br>
11.1 OneBill offers Customers a budget plan based on predictive algorithms for managing and
projecting utility costs, aiming for a net-zero balance over the course of a year ("Budget
Plan"). The Budget Plan is flexible and may be adjusted based on actual usage and
preferences through the Platform.
<br>
11.2 Once the Budget Plan has been set on the Platform, the Customer shall be charged a
weekly, fortnightly or monthly fee subject to that Budget Plan which will cover their use of
the Services being payment for any invoices due to suppliers under the Services
("Supplier Invoices") and the OneBill Fee (together the "Budget Plan Fee").
<br>

Budget Plan Fee based on changes in usage, pricing, or services managed through the
Platform. We strive to maintain as stable a Budget Plan Fee as possible. However, should
there be a need to change your Budget Plan Fee, we will notify you approximately 3 days
prior to the Budget Plan Fee being due. We ensure to keep these adjustments minimal
and as infrequent as possible, aiming for a predictable and manageable billing cycle for
you.
<br>
<strong>12 Fees, Payments, and Billing</strong> <br>

12.1 OneBill Fee <br>
SCHEDULE 1 By agreeing to use the Service, you shall pay us a single consolidated
monthly fee for the aggregate Service provided ("OneBill Fee"). The OneBill Fee may
increase based on the number of services you choose to include using our Platform.
Detailed descriptions of each service tier, associated benefits, and pricing will be available
on the Platform. All fees are due upon the invoice date and will be billed according to the
selected payment method you chose on the Platform. The OneBill Fee is based on a
usage and price estimation that aims to reflect your actual utility consumption and the
current rates available. You understand and agree that this is an estimate and actual
costs may vary based on actual usage, changes in utility rates, or changes in services.
<br>12.2 Supplier Invoices
<br>
As part of the Services, you will be issued with Supplier Invoices on a periodic basis. The
Supplier Invoices will appear on the Platform and will specify therein when they are due
for payment. When the Supplier Invoices are due, we will facilitate payment to the supplier
from your Customer Account.
<br>
You will pay us the Budget Plan Fee together with any VAT and any other applicable
charges described for each Service you subscribe for or purchase in accordance with
these Terms. Full details of the applicable fees can be found on our Website.
You will be responsible for all taxes associated with your use of Services that are
attributable to or due by you. If an applicable tax authority requires us to pay any taxes
that should have been payable by you, we will advise you in writing, and you will promptly
reimburse us for the amounts paid.
<br>
12.3 Subscription Service <br>
1 Ongoing access to all Services and features of the Platform requires a
subscription to one of our plans (“Subscription”). <br>

2 The first 30 days of your Subscription, will constitute the “Initial Service Term”.
Your Subscription will be automatically renewed for successive periods of 30 days, each a
“Renewal Period”, and you will continue to be charged fees for the Subscription on a
monthly basis, until your Subscription is cancelled in accordance with clause The Initial
Service Term together with any subsequent Renewal Periods will constitute the “Service
Term”.
<br>
3 OneBill offers several plans as part of the Subscription: Savvy Saver, Super
Saver, or Saver Pro. You can switch between the plans at any time through the Platform,
however, this will result in a change to the OneBill Fee. <br>
4 As such, if we do decide to change OneBill Fee for the Subscription plan that you
are currently subscribed to, we will not impose those new fees on you without advanced
prior written notice and we will allow you to choose whether to continue your Subscription
on the revised prices before we begin charging you at the new price. <br>
12.4 Payment Method and Missed Payment Penalties <br>
OneBill accepts various payment methods, including variable bank transfers. OneBill will
require one principal payment method to be added to your account on the Platform and
an alternative backup payment method which cannot include a credit card or other debt
facility ("Alternative Payment Method"). <br>
Where you miss a payment when due, a fee of €15.00 is applied to your account through
the Platform ("Missed Payment Fee"). Where there are three consecutive missed
payments on your account, OneBill may terminate your account. <br>
12.5 Unpaid Direct Debit Fee <br>
In the event a direct debit payment is returned as unpaid by your bank, a €10.00 charge
will be automatically applied to your account as an unpaid direct debit fee ("Unpaid Direct
Debit Fee"). Following an unpaid direct debit, you will receive a reminder letter requesting
payment of the outstanding balance, which will need to be made using the Alternative
Payment Method. Additionally, you may be required to complete a new direct debit
mandate for future payments to avoid further issues. <br>
It's important to remember that one payment through OneBill covers all bills you manage
through the Platform. Therefore, price changes, meter readings, usage peaks and
troughs, seasonality, and product changes may necessitate adjustments to your payment
amount. <br>
By agreeing to these Terms, you acknowledge and accept the possibility of such
adjustments and the terms associated with the Unpaid Direct Debit Fee. We encourage
you to maintain sufficient funds in your account on the due date to avoid any unnecessary
charges and interruptions to your service
12.6 Refunds <br>
All payments you make are non-cancellable and non-refundable, subject only to the
provisions of this clause and our indemnity clause.
Subscriptions <br>
When you first sign up to the Platform by purchasing a Subscription, you can cancel your
purchase and ask for a refund by telling us in writing of your wish to cancel within 14 days
of purchasing your Subscription (“Cooling-off Period”). For the avoidance of doubt, a
supplier may have a separate cooling off period and the Customer should make
themselves aware of the supplier's terms upon entering into an agreement with them.
We will assess your refund request and we will only process a refund if we are satisfied
that there are no Supplier Invoices due for the Customer.
<br>
Subscriptions are non-refundable after the Cooling-off Period.
<br>
12.7 We may refund fees at our sole discretion
<br>
5 We may decide to refund the fees you have paid for the Services if we at our sole
discretion consider that we do not have the technical infrastructure to provide the Services
to you at the time of your purchase.
<br>
<strong>13 Customer Account</strong> <br>

13.1 The Customer agrees to provide funds in accordance with the Budget Plan Fee for the
purpose of paying the OneBill Fee and the Supplier Invoices. The Budget Plan Fee will be
held in a segregated account ("Customer Account") established by OneBill for the benefit
of the Customer. <br>

13.2 The Customer authorises OneBill to receive and hold the Budget Plan Fee in the
Customer Account until payment is due to the respective utility suppliers.
<br>
13.3 OneBill will utilise the funds within the Customer Account to pay the Customer's utility
invoices on their behalf. OneBill is authorised to make payments directly to the utility
suppliers from the Customer Account on or before the due date specified in the supplier's
invoice. <br>
13.4 In consideration for providing the Services, OneBill will charge and extract the OneBill Fee
from the Customer Account. <br>
13.5 OneBill will provide the Customer with regular statements detailing the transactions made
on behalf of the Customer, including Supplier Invoices and the deduction of the OneBill
Fee. The Customer is responsible for reviewing the statements and notifying OneBill of
any discrepancies within 7 days of receipt. <br>
13.6 Should the Customer Account lack sufficient funds to cover the Supplier Invoices and/or
the OneBill Fee at any time, OneBill will notify the Customer of such deficiency. OneBill
will be authorised to issue a direct debit request to the payment method provided by the
Customer, for any shortfall. <br>
13.7 Funds held within the Customer Account will be kept separate from One Bill's corporate
funds and will not be used for any corporate purposes, including but not limited to,
operating expenses, investments, or loans. <br>
13.8 OneBill is committed to ensuring the security of Customer funds. The Customer Account
will be held at a reputable financial institution and will be subject to the protections
provided by applicable law. <br>
<strong>14 Cost sharing amongst Housemates</strong> <br>

14.1 This clause applies to Customers who have registered as occupants of a single property
on our Platform (each a "Housemate" comprising a "Household") and wish to utilise the
Platform's cost sharing feature. All Housemates must be registered on the Platform to
participate in the cost-sharing program. Each Housemate is required to create an
individual account that will be linked to the Household's main account.
<br>14.2 The Platform will calculate each Housemate's share of the utility bills ("Shared Costs")
based on the total costs of the Household's utility bills, the number of Housemates and
the Services chosen by that Housemate – which will comprise the Budget Plan of the
Household. Each Housemate agrees to contribute their share of the Shared Costs by the
due date specified by the Platform each month ("Contribution Date"). The Platform will
issue reminders to each Housemate prior to the Contribution Date.
<br>14.3 In the event that a Housemate fails to make their payment by the Contribution Date, the
Platform may:
(a) Send additional payment reminders to the non-paying Housemate;
(b) Notify other Housemates of the missed payment; or
(c) Apply a Missed Payment Fee to the Housemate.
<br>14.4 Any adjustments to the Shared Costs due to changes in the Household (e.g., a
Housemate moving out) or disputes regarding the Shared Costs must be reported to the
Platform promptly. The Platform will provide tools to facilitate the resolution of such
disputes but is not responsible for mediating disagreements between Housemates.
<br>14.5 The Platform acts solely as a facilitator for the calculation and collection of Shared Costs.
Each Housemate is individually and collectively responsible for the full amount of the
Household's utility bills. The Platform is not liable for any non-payment or default by any
Housemate.
<br>14.6 A Housemate may opt out of the cost-sharing arrangement by notifying the Platform and
the other Housemates in accordance with the Platform's policies. Remaining Housemates
will have their Shared Costs recalculated to reflect the change in the Household
composition.
<br>
<strong>15 Termination and Cancellation Policy</strong> <br>

15.1 Users may terminate their accounts at any time through the Platform, subject to a 30-day
notice period to expire no earlier than the end of the Initial Service Term or applicable
Renewal Period. OneBill reserves the right to terminate or suspend accounts for breaches
of these Terms, including non-payment. The Customer should be aware that where the
Services are terminated between you and us, this does not terminate the agreements you
may have with suppliers (as they may have fixed term contracts). Upon a termination or
cancellation of the Services by OneBill or the Customer, OneBill will notify all suppliers
and facilitate a handover. However, it will be the responsibility of the Customer to ensure
that they are aware of the supplier's terms on the continuation of that relationship between
the Customer and the supplier.
<br>15.2 We will stop the Service as soon as possible but this will not affect switches we have
already performed for you. You must notify us if you wish to:
(a) cancel your energy supply;
(b) undertake a switch of energy tariff (including a switch to an energy tariff offered by
a supplier other than your existing supplier) without using the Service; or
(c) if you move property.
If you fail to notify us, we will not know that your circumstances have changed, and we will
continue to provide the Service.
<br>15.3 We shall be entitled to terminate your subscription for the Service at any time by written
notice to you if you are in breach of these Terms, including (without limitation) your
responsibilities or in the event that you provide us with false or misleading information in
connection with the Service or for non-payment of the Budget Plan Fee or if you use the
Service for purposes not permitted hereunder (including (without limitation) those
purposes which are expressly prohibited by the succeeding provisions of this clause). In
such circumstances, you will not be entitled to any refund.
<br>15.4 We may also terminate or suspend your subscription if:
(a) for any technical or legal reasons we are prevented from delivering the Service; or
(b) any application for a new energy supply contract made on your behalf is
unsuccessful (including where you are deemed by a supplier to have failed any
pre-contract check(s) undertaken by such supplier, which may include checks
regarding your financial circumstances and/or credit history).
<br>15.5 Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this clause, we may (in our absolute
discretion) cancel, withdraw or suspend the Service (and accordingly terminate your
subscription) at any time for any reason (including (without limitation) any business
reason, technical reason or legal reason).
<br>15.6 Some of these Terms will continue to be enforceable, even after termination including,
without limitation, the right to be paid, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and
limitations of liability <br>
<strong>16 Continuous Adjustment and Optimisation</strong> <br>
16.1 You agree that the Budget Plan Fee may continuously adjust and optimise based on
real-time conditions, variables, and factors affecting utility consumption and pricing. These
adjustments are part of One Bill's commitment to providing an adaptive and responsive
utility management service that reflects current usage patterns and market conditions.
While we strive to provide the most accurate estimations and keep your payments stable,
these adjustments are necessary to ensure that your payments reflect your actual utility
costs. We will provide notifications of any significant changes to your payment amount in
advance, as detailed in the Unpaid Direct Debit Fee section.
<br>16.2 By incorporating these items, you ensure that users are clearly informed of their
agreement and consent to the Services, the nature of the Services, and the specifics of
how payments are handled and adjusted. <br>
<strong>17 Liability and Disclaimer</strong> <br>
17.1 We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do
so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the
negligence of our team and for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
<br>17.2 We shall not be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential
damages, including but not limited to, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other
intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use
the services; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the services; (iii) any content
obtained from the services; and (iv) unauthorised access, use, or alteration of your
transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence)
or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such
damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its essential
purpose. <br>
17.3 The Platform and all materials, information, software, facilities, services, and other content
are provided on an "As Is" and "As Available" basis without warranties of any kind, either
express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Platform or any of its functions will be
uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the Platform or the
servers that make it available are free of viruses or other harmful components.
<br>17.4 Customers access and use the Platform and its content at their own risk. We will not be
liable for any damages of any kind arising from or relating to the use of the Platform,
including, but not limited to, direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, and consequential
damages.
<br>17.5 We do not endorse or make any warranties or representations about the accuracy,
reliability, or any other aspect of the content provided by the Platform or any third party
linked to or from the Platform. Links to third-party websites do not constitute an
endorsement by us of such websites or the content, products, advertising, or other
materials presented on such websites.
<br>17.6 The Platform may provide tools or information that could be used for managing financial
decisions; however, users are solely responsible for their financial decisions and actions.
We are not a financial advisor, and the information provided by the Platform is not
intended as financial advice.
<br>17.7 We are not responsible for the actions or omissions of any Customer of the Platform. In
no event shall we be liable for any shared expenses, debts, or other financial obligations
among Customers or Housemates. Responsibility for settling financial matters remains
solely with the Customers.
<br>17.8 We are not responsible for what suppliers or other third parties do or fail to do. Even if we
have helped you switch to a new supplier or energy tariff, we are not responsible for
damage or loss you suffer under that independent contract.
<br>17.9 You understand that the selected supplier may run a credit check on you to ensure you
are able to pay your utility bills. The result of this credit check may mean the supplier asks
you for a deposit before starting to supply or they may refuse to supply your energy
entirely. Further details may be found on the specific supplier’s terms and conditions.
<br>17.10 The Service is tailored to individual preferences and circumstances and our decisions are
made based on the details provided to us by you or by third parties. However, it remains
your responsibility to ensure suitability and adequacy of the product or service that is
selected by us. If you are uncertain as to the suitability or adequacy of any product or
service chosen for you during the provision of the Service, you should seek independent
professional advice.
<br>17.11 In no event shall the total liability of OneBill arising out of or related to these Terms or the
Services, whether based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any
other legal theory, exceed the total fees paid by the Customer to OneBill for the Services
in the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of the claim.
<br><strong>18 Your responsibilities under these Terms</strong><br>
In order to use the Website and Service you:
(a) must be 18 years old or over and have an address in Ireland; <br>
(b) must ensure that all information and details (in particular your email address and <br>
mobile telephone number) you provide to us are true, accurate, complete and
current, and that you disclose all relevant facts to us whether specifically
requested or not;
(c) must promptly update us with any changes to such information via the Platform; <br>
(d) where required, you must have obtained the consent from all other Housemates in
your Household to use our Service; <br>
(e) must, in order to use our Service, create an account and be responsible for any
and all activity conducted using your account on the Platform; <br>
(f) must promptly contact us on info@onebill.ie if you know or suspect that anyone
other than you has accessed your account on the Platform; <br>
(g) agree that you shall be solely liable under, for and in respect of any energy supply
contract between you and any supplier (including in respect of the relevant energy
tariff applicable thereto), whether such contract arises as a result of a Switch or
otherwise, and (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) that: (i) we
shall have no responsibility whatsoever for any payments due from you to any
Supplier nor any other responsibility, liability or obligation whatsoever of any
nature, howsoever expressed, under any such energy supply contract; and (ii) you
are responsible for transferring all payments due to any Supplier on the terms and
at the time specified by such Supplier; <br>
(h) you will be fully responsible for conducting a meter reading at the beginning of the
contract and provide figures and images of this reading. You may do this by taking
a picture of the meter reading on your smartphone and uploading to the Platform.
This will include GPS location, a timestamp and other metadata to ensure
accuracy. In order to provide this evidence of a meter reading you will need to
agree to use this feature on your smartphone; <br>
(i) you are only using the Platform for your own personal use, in your capacity as a
Housemate of a Household or as a person with appropriate authority on behalf of
a company or other legal entity; and <br>
(j) you comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and court orders; and that
you adhere to all our published policies then in effect. <br>
5.1 Should you not be able to confirm the above you must stop using
the Platform and our Services immediately. <br>

<strong>19 Our capacity as an agent</strong> <br>

We do not supply your energy, we just facilitate the switching process and manage
the payments. To complete a switch, a separate contract will be created between
you and the supplier. We are not responsible for and have no liability under, for or
in respect of that separate contract and you should also read your supplier’s terms
and conditions carefully (including (without limitation) requirements relating to
meter reading, payment, billing, account management and customer service). For
the avoidance of doubt, the supplier is responsible for supplying your energy in
return for you paying the supplier for such supply. <br>
19.1 We will make assessments from time to time, at such intervals as we deem appropriate as
part of formulating the Budget Plan. During the application process you will be presented
with an opportunity to choose your subscription and your preferences. You can change
and update the information you have provided on your account at any time, on the
Platform. <br>
19.2 In order to assess or update the Budget Plan, we rely on information you provide to us
regarding your property and energy usage and regarding your past energy bills (which we
may request from suppliers). <br>

<strong>20 Complaints</strong> <br>
20.1 If you are reading this section you are probably unhappy. So, first things first, we are
sorry. <br>
20.2 We want all of our Customers to have a fantastic experience when using OneBill, so when
we hear that we have not provided a service to that standard, we want to ensure we make
things right. <br>
20.3 We hope that most matters can be resolved either through our [chat support, or through
an email or video-chat conversations with one of the members of our team].
20.4 However, we appreciate that some matters sometimes require further escalation. That is
what this section is for. <br>
20.5 Should you find that you need to make a complaint, we can assure you that it will be
addressed swiftly, fairly and efficiently, so that we can find a resolution as quickly as
possible. <br>
20.6 If you have a complaint, we ask that you do the following: <br>
(a) • Write an email addressed to info@onebill.ie <br>
(b) • Enter the subject line: “I have a complaint” and add your name (or the
account that complaint relates to on the Platform) <br>
(c) • In the body of the email, please describe as much as possible the nature
of the complaint, including when the issue happened and who you had been
dealing with in our team <br>
20.7 After you send your complaint email, you will receive an acknowledgement email from us
within 24-48 hours. <br>
20.8 A senior member of our organisation will review the complaint and contact you to organise
a call with you, or write back to you to discuss the matter in greater detail with you, within
3 working days from the acknowledgement email. This initial response may offer a
resolution or may begin a dialogue in an attempt to reach the best possible outcome. <br>
20.9 A final resolution or decision on the matter of your complaint will be communicated to you
within 7 working days of the acknowledgement email. <br>

<strong>21 Severability</strong> <br>
6 If any reference in these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that
provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these
Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. <br>
<strong>22 Assignment</strong> <br>
7 Our agreement under these Terms is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable
by you except with our prior written consent. We may transfer and assign any of our rights
and obligations under these Terms without consent. <br>
<strong>23 Entire Agreement</strong><br>
These Terms, together with the acts of our duly authorised agents constitute the entire
agreement between the parties and supersede all other agreements, statements, letters
and other arrangements between the parties in relation to the subject matter hereof. Each
party acknowledges that it has not relied on or been induced to enter these Terms by a
representation other than those expressly set out in these Terms. This clause does not
affect a party’s liability in respect of a fraudulent misrepresentation. <br>
<strong>24 Notices</strong> <br>

All notices under these Terms will be deemed to have been duly given when received, or
if transmitted by email, the day after it is sent. <br>
<strong>25 Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong> <br>
These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their
subject matter, formation, existence, negotiation, validity, termination or enforceability
(including non-contractual obligations, disputes or claims) (“Dispute”) shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland and the parties submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland in relation to any Dispute between them.
SCHEDULE 2 <br>
<strong>1 Data Protection</strong> <br>
1.1 It's your data
Any personal, company and user-generated information will only ever be uploaded
voluntarily by you and you confirm that you have obtained the necessary consent and
have given appropriate notices to lawfully upload any other individual's personal data to
our Platform for the duration and purposes of these Terms. We'll never share or make
your data or information available to anyone without your explicit permission (other than
being legally required such as by a court order). <br>
Your data is uploaded and downloaded over a secure connection, your credentials are
encrypted and hashed. We don't store (or even know) your password. Your personal data
and any confidential information you may upload to the Platform is stored securely, and
only people you've assigned as members of your team (in addition to any persons
approved under clause 1.4) can access your data, per the access permissions you
assigned to those team members. We expect you to ensure that you, and particularly
those you give access to, have strong passwords, ideally different from their social
network site logins. <br>
1.2 Account creation <br>
If you establish an account on the Platform, you are responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your user ID and password, and you are responsible for all activities that
occur under your password or user ID. You agree to: (i) log out from your account at the
end of each session; and (ii) immediately notify us at info@onebill.ie of any unauthorised
use of your password or user ID or any other breach of security. <br>
You are responsible for all content that you transmit or otherwise make available to our
Website and Platform. Your access to and use of this Platform may be monitored,
including but not limited to, for the purpose of identifying illegal or unauthorised activities. <br>
1.3 Data collection <br>
Subject to the confidentiality obligations created under these Terms (see below), you
agree that we have the right to collect and analyse specific data points and other
information gained from your profile, settings and including but not limited to interactions
with our team on our chat support. This covers, without limitation, information concerning
your data and data derived therefrom, and we will be free (during and after the term
hereof) to (i) request bills, usage and cost history for you from relevant suppliers and (ii)
use such information and data to improve and enhance the Website/Platform and for
other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with the
Website/Platform. This is for the mutual benefit of all our users. <br>
1.4 Granting ourselves access for customer support purposes
Occasionally you may contact us for customer support. It may be necessary for our team
to access your profile page for the purpose of assistance, to enable them to see what you
are having an issue with or for them to inspect documents you have referred to. This will
only happen with your implied consent to do so, such as during an active conversation
between yourself and a team member or where it is necessary to answer a question you
have asked them on email/chat support. <br>
Once you have finished working with that team member, they will remove their access
from your profile. We also require our team members to regularly review the list of
companies they have access to and to remove themselves from any company that they
are not actively assisting to minimise the risk of any data breach. <br>
1.5 Providing platform feedback <br>
If you give us feedback on the Platform, for example recommendations for improvements
or features, such feedback will be deemed non-confidential and non-proprietary and
implementation of that feedback is owned by us and may become part of the Website or
the Platform without compensation to you. We reserve all rights in and to the Platform
unless we expressly state otherwise. <br>
1.6 Phone, SMS and email contact <br>
1.7 Who is the controller and who is the processor <br>
As part of providing the Website, the Platform and the Services to you, we will process
personal data. We will do so either as a data controller (meaning, we decide the manner
and purpose of the processing) or data processor (meaning, we process the data on your
behalf and on your instructions) depending on the circumstances. In this clause, "personal
data", "data controller" and "data processor" have the meanings given to them in the
European Union General Data Protection Regulation. <br>
When we process your personal data for our own business purposes (for example,
creating your account, managing our relationship with you, liaising with suppliers,
handling customer service questions and managing billing and invoicing), we are the data
controller. In that case, we will process personal data in accordance with this Schedule.
When we process personal data on your behalf (for example, contact details, utility bills),
we are the data processor. In that case, we will process personal data in accordance
with this Schedule. <br>
Both parties will comply, where appropriate, with all applicable requirements of the
European Union General Data Protection Regulation, the Irish Data Protection Acts
1988-2018 and all other mandatory data protections laws and regulations applicable in
Ireland from time to time ("Data Protection Legislation"). This clause is in addition to,
and does not relieve, remove or replace, a party's obligations or rights under the Data
Protection Legislation. <br>
1.8 What data we will process on your behalf <br>
When we act as a data processor on your behalf, we will carry out the processing
activities below: <br>
(a) Subject matter of the processing: the provision of the Website, the Platform and
Services to you. <br>
(b) Duration of the processing: starting on the date you provide the relevant
personal data to us (for example by creating a profile on our Platform) until you
either remove the relevant personal data from the Platform or delete your account
with us. <br>
(c) Nature and purpose of the processing: providing relevant personal details and
documents on the Platform, allowing us to analyse the information and ensure we
calculate a comprehensive Budget Plan for the purposes of providing the Services
to you. <br>
(d) Type of personal data involved: name, address, email address, of each of the
members of your profile, billing details and smart meter data. <br>
(e) Categories of data subject: you, members of your household (where applicable)
and members using your profile on the Platform. <br>
1.9 We will only act on your documented instructions
<br>
We will only act on your documented instructions (including with regard to transfers of
personal data to a third country or an international organisation) unless we are required
by law to act without such instructions. You can provide us with your instructions by
making selections and inputting information on the Platform, or when you communicate
with us. <br>
If we are required by law to process personal data and don't have your instructions to do
so, we will notify you before we carry out the processing required by law (unless the law
prohibits us from notifying you).
<br>
1.10 We will take steps to ensure data is processed securely <br>
We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure we
can securely process personal data. This includes measures to address the particular
risks that are presented by processing, for example from accidental or unlawful
destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to the personal data we
process on your behalf. When implementing these measures, we will take into account:
(a) the state of technological development and the availability of relevant technology
(for the purposes of Article 32(1) of the GDPR); <br>
(b) the costs of implementation of any measures (which may include, where
appropriate, pseudonymisation and encrypting personal data, ensuring
confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of our systems and services,
ensuring that availability of and access to personal data can be restored in a
timely manner after an incident, and regularly assessing and evaluating the
effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures we have adopted); <br>
(c) the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing; and <br>
(d) the risks for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. <br>
1.11 Everyone who processes personal data is under a duty of confidence <br>
We will ensure that everyone who has access to or processes personal data on your
behalf agrees to keep the data confidential. This mainly includes our employees who are
subject to confidentiality obligations under their employment contracts. If we engage any
third parties to process personal data on your behalf, we will ensure that they are subject
to a duty of confidentiality before we share any personal data with them. <br>
1.12 General authority to appoint sub-processors <br>
By accepting these Terms, you authorise us to appoint third parties to process personal
data as a sub-processor as we see fit. This clause will be deemed to be your general
written authorisation under Article 28(2) of the GDPR. We will let you know if we plan to
make any changes concerning the addition or replacement of any sub-processors before
we make the change. <br>
When we engage a sub-processor, we will ensure that we have a written contract in place
with the sub-processor that sets out the same data protection obligations on the third
party as are set out in this clause (or substantially on that sub-processor's standard terms
of business), in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate
technical and organisational measures to ensure that the processing will meet the
requirements of the relevant Data Protection Legislation. <br>
If we appoint a sub-processor, we remain fully liable to you for the performance of the
sub-processor data protection obligations. <br>
1.13 International transfers <br>
If we need to transfer any personal data outside Ireland (for example, if our service
providers store personal data on servers outside Ireland) we will ensure that appropriate
safeguards are in place to keep the data secure, and that effective legal remedies are
available for data subjects, or that there is an 'adequacy decision' (as defined in the Data
Protection Act 2018). If we need to transfer any data, we will comply with our obligations
under the relevant Data Protection Legislation to provide an adequate level of protection
to any personal data that is transferred. <br>
<strong>Customer Payment Flow Example
  Single Bill Payer -</strong> <br>
1. Customer signs up to Onebill on their chosen Onebill subscription plan <br>
2. Customer signs LOA and signs Direct Debit mandate <br>
3. Customer submits old billing data within the portal <br>
4. OneBill contacts customers existing suppliers <br>
5. Suppliers send OneBill your bills <br>
6. OneBill creates a payment plan based on your tariff and usage that includes all your bills

7. OneBill Direct Debit covers the cost of your utilities as well as your subscription fee in a
prorata form based on your chosen billing cycle. <br>
8. OneBill continues to work for you in the background daily, as a better deal is available
you'll be switched automatically if you've requested this service, your budget plan will be
updated and so will your Direct Debit <br>
<strong>House Sharing Multiple Bill Payers -</strong> <br>
1. Lead customer signs up to Onebill on their chosen Onebill subscription plan <br>
2. A 2nd customer / sharer at the same address signs up to OneBill and they will be asked if
they wish to split the bills with another user or keep their bills separate. This will repeat for
each additional customer / sharer who signs up at this address. <br>
3. The lead customer has to accept each additional customer / sharer to enable the bill
sharing within the portal. <br>
4. All customers sign LOA and sign individual Direct Debit mandates for their share of the
bills and their subscription plan fee. <br>
5. Lead customer submits old billing data within the portal <br>
6. OneBill contacts customers existing suppliers <br>
7. Suppliers send OneBill your bills <br>
8. OneBill creates a payment plan based on your tariff and usage that includes all your bills
and subscription plan. This is viewable in your portal anytime. This will be split between
all the sharers based on the percentage split setup within your portals. Each user will
have a direct debit to pay for their share of the bills. <br>
9. OneBill Direct Debit covers the cost of your utilities as well as your subscription fee in a
prorata form based on your chosen billing cycle. <br>
10. OneBill continues to work for you in the background daily, as a better deal is available
you'll be switched automatically if you've requested this service, your budget plan will be
updated and so will your Direct Debit <br>
11. If one or more sharing customers fails to pay their share of the bill, the other sharers will
be liable for the outstanding amount. This could, depending on the service, mean that
some services are suspended and stop working until the payments have been brought up
to date. <br>
